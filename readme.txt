
SUDOKU IS VERY FAMOUS AND MUCH ENJOYABLE MATHEMATICAL GAME, SO I SELECTED THIS AS MY PROJECT FOR 
THE COURSE. I LOVE MATHS AND CODING A LOT, BECAUSE OF THAT THIS PROJECT IS SUITS ME BEST.

FIRST, I STARTED WITH THE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DEVELOP LOGIC TO GENERATE THE SUDOKU GAME BOARD, 
WHICH IN THINKING LOOKS VERY EASY, BUT WHEN I STARTED CODING I FOUND TOO MUCH COMPLEXITIES AND 
I HAVE TO IMPLEMENT BACK TRACING LOGIC TO SUCCESSFULLY GENERATE A 9X9 METRICS OF THE GAME ACCORDING 
TO THE SUDOKU RULES.

THERE ARE MAIN 3 RULES FOR THE GAME:
1)	9 CELLS IN EACH ROW HAVE POSSIBLE VALUES FROM 1 TO 9 AND THEY SHOULD NOT REPEAT.
2)	9 CELLS IN EACH COLUMN HAVE POSSIBLE VALUES FROM 1 TO 9 AND THEY SHOULD NOT REPEAT.
3)	IN THE SMALL METRICS OF 3X3 VALUES 1 TO 9 SHOULD NOT REPEAT.
IF THIS RULE ARE FOLLOWED THEN THE GENERATED METRICS IS CORRECT.

SECONDLY, AFTER GENERATING THE DATA FOR THE METRICS I HAVE TO MAKE IT PLAYABLE BY PROVIDING 
SOME EMPTY CELLS TO THE PLAYER.

AT LAST, I HAVE DESIGNED UI FOR THE GAME USING HTML AND CSS AND ALSO DESIGNED ONE LEARNING OPTION 
FOR THE NEW USER.

NEW USER CAN FOLLOW THAT OPTION AND LEARN HOW TO PLAY SUDOKU AND THEN START PLAYING THE GAME.
WHEN USER GIVES SOME INPUT, THE CODE WILL CHECK AND CHANGE THE COLOUR OF THE CELL GREEN IF THE 
VALUE IS CORRECT OTHERWISE CHANGE IT TO RED, SO USER CAN FIND OTHER POSSIBLE VALUE FOR THAT CELL.
